## Anymail Example

There are a plethora of email servers that one can connect to with all kinds of functionality and security.  To work with Django's batteries included frameworking, [django-anymail](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail) has popped up as a solution with over 1,600 stars on GitHub.  This is just a simple proof of concept to demonstrate how to integrate an email backend like MailGun into Django.

Alternatively, MailGun can be configured outside of Django's framework using [code from their tutorial](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html#verify-your-domain).

In addition to what is shown here, the domain has to be set up to send email from MailGun and can be [connected using a different MailGun tutorial](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/15351999098523-Google-Domains-DNS-Setup-Guide).
